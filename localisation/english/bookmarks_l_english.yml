 GATHERING_STORM_NAME:0 "Canistra"
 GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "At the beginning of the Kerbals of the North RP, there was hardly any action. Now, in the year 1492, tensions have begun to rise as countless events happen across Canistra. How will you guide your nation to victory in this unwavering age of instability?"
 HITTING_FAN_NAME:0 "The Hitting of the Fan"
 HITTING_FAN_DESC:0 "Yup, that's right! That umbrella collection is about to come in real handy."
 KHR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Tzaredom of Khrista is a unique being, with its modern form only coming into existance in 1486. Rocked by a failed fascist dictatorship, the Khristan church has stepped into the government to reshape the country into a theocracy. At least for now, Svelven II is in control.\n\nKhrista's place in the rising tensions is a delicate balance. They possess especially good relations with Spacostan, but also some of Spacostan's deepest enemies. It is unknown which side they will take when time forces their hand."
 NRT_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Initially a confederation of city-states, the people of Northernia centralized and bizarrely elected an authoritarian yet democratic communist government into power. The Northern Parliament and other democratic institutions remain devided on the current state of the North.\n\nWith Mr. Stalout's power at a new high, many are looking for alternatives. The upcoming election of 1493 may be a wonderful time to shake up the country, and guide it to a new path, or continue along with its "state socialism"."
 RYZ_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "As a federation in the long ago, Ryzania experienced a brief stint of monarchism. After a subsequent civil war, with the Green Army being victorious, the Ryzanian Federation was proclaimed. However, after notorious authoritarian Alamar Pytan was elected, instability has been at its highest, with threats of a new civil war being woven into its political system.\n\nMany factions will undoubtedly vie for power in an almost inevitable power vacuum, and it is up to the nation to find out who will fill it."
 PLK_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Policka has been thrusted into the midst of civil war after the failure of its flawed democratic institution became apparent. Communist forces headquartered in Czewrotow are at war with fascist Retula, both feeding off of the corpse of democracy.\n\nIt is becoming increasingly clear that the winner of the Polickan civil war will gain immense power, and already outside nations are taking interest and sending their support to their side. Whoever wins will win it big."
 HDD_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Haid' Dab is a perfect example of what can go right in a deliberately planned authoritarian state. Ever since Haid and Dab became one, a despot has been in control. Now, Nouri Al-Bakr guides the nation through increasing Canistran turmoil, as Haid' Dabians across are discontent with their worldly neighbors.\n\nMuch support has been given to those against the despotism of Haid' Dab, including internal rivals. Whether Al-Bakr will win or be ousted is entirely up to the hand of those deciding."
 TGF_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "What once started as a mere Ibarthi settler colony has turned into a great power. Now flunged perhaps too quickly into modernity, it is griped with internal crises while dominating on the world stage. Regionalism in Ortaria and Cherbourg are ever-increasing, and it seems as if the Frontier is headed to collapse.\n\nAs the lights that make the jewel shine become dim, regionalism will define the Frontier for years. Whoever is the inevitable victor will undoubtedly define a new era of the Frontaliers."
 IBA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "For such a large nation, Ibarthelastorosa is surprisingly at peace. Occasional internal resistance is spotted, but is dealt with swiftly. The defining characteristic of the nation is simply "large", except population. The up-and-coming population crisis is something the king may have to spend more than just a conference focusing on.\n\nIbarthelastorosa is in the perfect place to supply the world with goods for as long as its industrial base is present. Perhaps it will be needed in the near future."
 OTHER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Many other nations within Canistra, both large and small, are all contending for a spot in history, especially now. With tensions rising and the first major global conflict in the history of Canistra looming, it is up to them to decide how they will reserve their spot in the history books."

 VIB_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The once isolationist nation of Vibonia has now just begun to open up its borders, and eyes, to the world. Going through ups and downs, it has now settled in its state of tranquility, with an active, guiding democracy having no signs of being interrupted.\n\nHowever, there have been the occasional talks of change within Vibonia. Perhaps the figurehead monarch, with his own ideas, has something to say about the new diplomacy policies. Perhaps this tranquil state is not so tranquil after all."
